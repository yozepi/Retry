      TryIt offers a simple, fluent way to try/retry actions, methods and tasks. You can pause between retries using one of the built-in delay policies or create your own.
      You can also add error and success policies to fine tune your control of the process.
      **Warning** Versions 2.0.0 and above have several breaking changes with previous versions. See the documentation for details.
